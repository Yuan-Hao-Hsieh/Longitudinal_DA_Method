# Longitudinal_Data_Analysis

This repository contains a series of assignments and projects from my longitudinal data analysis course. The projects span topics from function plotting and numerical optimization to advanced modeling of repeated measures data. In many cases, key output tables (e.g., parameter estimates, ANOVA results, covariance structure comparisons) were generated using SAS, and their findings are incorporated into the project reports.

## Final Project  
**Topic:** Normal Mixture Parameter Estimation & Constrained Optimization  
- **Description:**  
  Estimation of parameters in mixed normal distributions. This project compares true versus estimated probability density functions and optimizes a log-likelihood function under constraints.  
- **Implementation Note:**  
  The estimation tables and model fit statistics were generated with SAS.

## Homework 1 – Python Function Plotting  
- **Description:**  
  A comprehensive exploration of Python’s plotting capabilities through the graphing of 11 distinct functions. Each function is analyzed for extrema, roots, asymptotes, and range, with detailed discussion and annotations.  
- **Implementation Note:**  
  While the graphs were created in Python, discussion notes on function behavior were informed by class examples.

## Homework 2 – ANOVA & Repeated Measures  
- **Description:**  
  Analysis of treatment effects in rabbits using both independent and non-independent data designs. ANOVA models were established to test the program effect, and SAS was used to generate the output tables (including expected mean squares and F-test results).  
- **Key Finding:**  
  In both models, the p-values for the treatment effects were significant (p < 0.05), leading to rejection of the null hypothesis.

## Homework 3 – Longitudinal Analysis in Pregnancy  
- **Description:**  
  This project compares serum ferritin and serum protein trends over time between control and treatment groups. It involves multiple model comparisons (using SAS output for parameter estimates, AIC, MSE, and CV) to identify significant time, group, and interaction effects.  
- **Implementation Note:**  
  The detailed parameter estimates and ANOVA tables were produced by SAS, and the discussion emphasizes which factors are statistically significant.

## Homework 4 – Covariance Structures & Model Selection  
- **Description:**  
  Evaluation of various covariance structures (e.g., AR(1) with unequal variances) for repeated measures data on blood lead levels. Likelihood tests and AIC comparisons were used to select the best-fitting model.  
- **Implementation Note:**  
  SAS was employed to generate the sample covariance matrices, correlation matrices, and model comparison tables.

## Homework 5 – Inhibition Value Analysis  
- **Description:**  
  Investigation of the effects of two drugs on inhibition values over time. The project includes residual analysis, variance estimation, and hypothesis testing (with likelihood ratio tests) for baseline and interaction effects.  
- **Implementation Note:**  
  Key tables and test outputs (including p-values and variance estimates) were generated using SAS procedures.

## Additional Assignments (p1–p5)  
These files (p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5) contain further detailed analyses in longitudinal data modeling:
- **p1:** Model comparisons for cardiac catheter ablation outcomes, with SAS-generated tables highlighting significant predictors.
- **p2:** ANOVA modeling and hypothesis testing regarding treatment effects on CV, with output produced via SAS.
- **p3:** Analysis of iron supplementation and anemia effects on pregnant women, comparing multiple models and their statistical tests.
- **p4:** Comparison of covariance structures and model selection (via AIC) in blood lead level studies.
- **p5:** Detailed residual and variance analyses for drug effects on inhibition values.
